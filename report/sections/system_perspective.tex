\section{System's Perspective}

\subsection{Design}

To develop our version of MiniTwit, we have chosen to use the programming language Go. We are using a toolkit called Gorilla that includes a number of different packages that each help with different things regarding web development. We use the library called GORM to interact with our PostgreSQL database instead of writing our own SQL queries. We use Prometheus to monitor our application - and Grafana to give us a dashboard with the Prometheus data. To log things like error messages, we use the ELK stack.

\subsection{Architecture}

\subsubsection{Components and connectors}
% This viewpoint is concerned with the run-time functionality of the system
Our system is structured such that the entire system is containerized using docker and then the container is deployed, which enables the user to access and use the application.
Our API and app are connected to the database container. Caddy is our reverse proxy. Caddy receives traffic and redirects it to either the API, app, Grafana or Kibana, using the same ports for all 4 services.

\subsubsection{Module Viewpoints}

\subsubsection*{Packages}

The system consists of three packages: src, CircleCI and Docker. The packages and their dependencies are visualized in figure \ref{fig:src}.

The Src package contains the system logic relevant to user actions in the app and API. The app handles UI inputs from the Minitwit website, whereas the API handles URL calls through HTTP. It also contains the monitoring and the controller packages.

The monitoring package contains two things. First and foremost, the monitoring infrastructure is set up with the Prometheus package.
The Prometheus Promauto functionality is used to define what metrics to track. We chose it because it sets up an easily extendable code structure.
Secondly, the method MiddlewareMetrics starts a timer and measures CPU usage before serving the http request it is handling. After having served the HTTP request it increments the request count and records the duration of the HTTP request. The metrics we monitor will be discussed in section \ref{Monitoring}.

The controller package will not be discussed in depth, since its functionality, in its entirety, is simply to define the structs for the database, to connect to the database, query a users ID from a username and hash passwords.
\newline
For a full overview of the entire Src package see appendix \ref{appendix:CCDiagram}

The Docker package is not tied to Minitwit functionality. Its purpose is to contain the instructions for initialization of our different docker containers when we deploy the system. This means that it contains a variety of file types. Naturally, it contains the .Dockerfile for the app and API. Furthermore, it contains .yml files with launch settings for our monitoring tools, Prometheus and Grafana. The grafana directory also includes .json files that define the UI for its dashboard. Finally, the package contains a Caddyfile, that defines the reverse proxy...
These files are run at every system initialization, building the containers, based on the data carried in the package.

Finally, the circleci package contains the functionality for CI/CD. It is linked to our Gitub repository, meaning that every time we merge a pull request into the MiniTwit repository's main branch, the setup in the Docker package is run.

\end{figure}

The following subsections will go in-depth with the Src package, namely its API and App packages, as they are paramount to system interaction. Below, in figure \ref{fig:src}, is an overview of the package. As implied at the start of the section, the App and API handle similar actions, but do not have any direct dependencies with one another.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Class overview of App}

Our App class consists of the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Main.go $\rightarrow$ our back-end functionality of the application
    \item Front-end, consisting of 4 HTML files
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Layout.html
        \item login.html
        \item register.html
        \item timeline.html
    \end{itemize}
    \item a single CSS file responsible for the UI-design of our front-end
\end{itemize}

Our app exposes HTTP-endpoints for the following use cases:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{/} $\rightarrow$ If user logged in, loading personal timeline, if not logged in, redirecting to \texttt{/public}
    \item \texttt{/favicon.ico} $\rightarrow$ does nothing really
    \item \texttt{/public} $\rightarrow$ loads the public timeline
    \item \texttt{/add\_message} $\rightarrow$ posting message on the web service
    \item \texttt{/login} $\rightarrow$ login opportunity for users
    \item \texttt{/register} $\rightarrow$ registration opportunity for users
    \item \texttt{/logout} $\rightarrow$ opportunity to log out of the web service
    \item \texttt{/\{username\}} $\rightarrow$ load the timeline of the given user
    \item \texttt{/\{username\}/follow} $\rightarrow$ logged in user wanting to follow user with  \texttt{\{username\}}
    \item \texttt{/\{username\}/unfollow} $\rightarrow$ logged in user wanting to unfollow user with \texttt{\{username\}}
\end{itemize}

In order to display data in the front-end, we make use of the struct \texttt{TimelineData}, which is basicly a container for the data fetched from the database. The struct \texttt{SessionData} is used to keep track of the data associated with the current session in the application. In other words, this is the struct, whose field, \texttt{Flashes}, is injected into the frontend, such that nothing is directly exposed to the front-end, thereby hidding the back-end functionality thus improving security of the site as well as keeping the code uncoupled such that changes in one part, does not break the other. To load the data on the frontend, we use the framework \textit{Go template} which allows for Go code to be loaded directly in the HTML without the need for javascript as middle layer.

\subsubsection*{Class overview of API}
The API makes use of HTTP requests by exposing HTTP-endpoints in order for the internal logic to handle the HTTP requests. Every end-point has been kept according to the initial python application.  
Our API has exposed endpoints for the following HTTP requests:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Registering users (POST) /api/register - if success, returns HTTP response code 204. If failing, returns HTTP response 400.
    \item Following a user (POST / GET) /api/follws/\{username\} - the method is checking if already followed (GET) and following / unfollowing (POST)  - if success, returns HTTP response code 204. If failing, returns HTTP response 404.
    \item Latest message (GET) /api/latest  - returns the ID of the latest message from the application.
    \item Messages pr user (GET) /api/msgs/\{username\} - if success, returns HTTP response code 204. If failing, returns HTTP response 405.
    \item Messages (feed) (GET) /api/msgs - if success, returns HTTP response code 204. If failing, returns HTTP response 405.
\end{itemize}

The API is meant to be run within a simulator environment, which acts as if the API is being accessed by real users. In our case, the API has failed quite a lot (around 90-95\%) but that is due to downtime on our database (4 days) and we are suspecting that a lot of the users were registered during these days and therefore we had a lot of errors. The errors arising from \textit{user does not exist} has also caused the problem that it camouflaged any errors not related to this. Due to the fact that it is not-very-DevOps-like to just register users (by using the "username" property in some endpoints and therefore allowing null-values in the database) when they did not exist, and the fact that it seemed that most of the groups we talked to had used this not-very-DevOps-like approach, we have been unable to find a way of resolving this in a proper matter.
    
\subsubsection{Deployment}
The deployment diagram below (See figure \ref{fig:deployment_diagram}) visualizes the dependencies between software containers, stored in docker containers, and the physical hardware that runs it. The system is hosted on a virtual machine hosted by DigitalOcean. The virtual machine runs Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and the OS runs the system in in a docker daemon, that contains individual docker containers and docker 
networks. 
\newline
The two docker networks are separated into logical units. The first unit is the main-network, which contains the system logic, monitoring tools and the database. The second network container, elk-network, contains the tools used to create logs. As the ELK setup doesn't need to communicate with any of the applications, it doesn't need to be in the same network. It works by Filebeat reading directly from the system directory that contains the logs from Docker containers, which is mounted as a Docker volume.

    \vspace{0.5em}
    \item Watchtower: A service for checking updates for Docker images and updating Docker containers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Important interactions of subsystems}
We use Docker Compose running multiple Docker containers for our system, such as Minitwit, ELK, Prometheus, etc. For automating the process of updating images, we use Watchtower.
\vspace{0.5em} \newline 
For logging we have set up our Docker Compose file to create containers for the three ELK images; Elasticsearch, Filebeat, and Kibana. Filebeat is the container that observes and ships data to Elasticsearch. Kibana then receives the data from Elasticsearch and visualizes it. 
\vspace{0.5em} \newline 
When new features are pushed to the Github repository's production branch, CircleCI triggers and re-deploys the system. 
\vspace{0.5em} \newline 
We monitor our application with Prometheus which collects metrics by scraping from a selection of HTTP endpoints. These metrics are then stored on the Prometheus server, and can be exported or visualized with Grafana.

SecureGo notified that the .md5 hashing algorithm is weak. Our system still uses it, as it is a requirement for Gravatar URLs.




\subsection{License compatibility}

Our MiniTwit application is licensed under the AGPLv3 license. After running the tool \textit{\href{https://github.com/uw-labs/lichen}{lichen}} on our code, we found no license violations. AGPLv3 is the most copy-left license that we know of, meaning that almost all other FOSS licenses are compatible with it.
