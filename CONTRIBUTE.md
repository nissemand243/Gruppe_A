# Contributing

### Which repository setup will we use?

We will be publishing our code in a git repository, that is pushed to a public repository on GitHub.

### Which branching model will we use?

We will use [trunk based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), as much as possible.

### Which distributed development workflow will we use?

We will be using a [centralized development workflow](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows#_centralized_workflow)

### How do we expect contributions to look like?

As the group expects to do pair programming, contributions will be sporadic.
The group uses the LiveShare extension for VS Code, that documents which users have collaborated on the contribution.

### Who is responsible for integrating/reviewing contributions?

At least one developer, other than the author(s), should review the contribution before it is merged into the trunk.
